# NuGet Error NU1105

<pre>Unable to read project information for 'ProjectFile'. The project file may be invalid/missing targets required for restore or the project might be unloaded.</pre>

### Issue
The project file exists but no restore information was provided for it.

### Solution
In Visual Studio, the error could mean that the project is unloaded, and thus NuGet was unable to load project information required to restore it. 

#### Solution in VS 2019 16.0 or later:
- Using a recent CLI version, restore the solution that includes that project from a command line prompt.

or

- Ensure the project is loaded as part of the current solution in Visual Studio, and then perform a solution restore inside of Visual Studio.

**Details:**
Unloaded projects, or projects that aren't included in the current VS Solution Filter, can still be part of a solution restore if they were restored from command line ([nuget.exe 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-5.0-rtm) or later) or Visual Studio 16.0 or later. In those cases, NuGet writes obj\<projectFileName>.nuget.dgspec.json with all project information that NuGet will need later, in case the "live project information" isn't available.

#### Solution in VS 2017 or before:
Make sure the project is part of your current solution in Visual Studio, and loaded. Then perform a solution restore.

### Issue
The project file exists but no restore information was provided for it.

### Solution
From the command line this could mean that the file is corrupt or that it doesn't contain the custom "after imports" target needed for restore to read the project. Check that the project file is valid and contains an "after imports" target.
